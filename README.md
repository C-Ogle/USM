# USM
Update Script Manager (USM) is a tool for use with Debian based Linux distributions. This tool runs in the terminal window, and provides a user friendly way of updating or installing either individual packages or a collection of packages. USMv1 supports 28 useful packages for a variety of purposes.

Experienced Linux users will likely find more streamlined practices by simply running terminal commands or writing custom bash scripts. This program was designed to be extremely user friendly for those with very limited experience or who are just getting into Linux operating systems, not to be the most streamlined tool for use by seasoned pros.

## How it Works
USMv1 requires a specific directory structure in order to function properly. Rather than requiring the user to manage the directory structure for dependent files, the usm_setup.py program creates the necessary directory and dependent files for the user. This minimizes the number of files that must be downloaded by the user and allows usm.py to be run from any directory with full functionality, since the path to directory files is directly specified.
